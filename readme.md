#Rubymine Preference Project

## Installation

* clone this repo, then follow the instructions in the Instructions.md file.



The purpose of this project is to create or compile keybindings for Sublime and Atom for use in Rubymine for present and incoming students at the Turing School of Software and Design.

At present the settings.jar file that is in this repository contains integration from the Sublime keybindings, work done by leopku (git@github.com:leopku/rubymine-keymap-sublime.git), as well as the common and Rubymine keybindings from Pivotal Labs (https://github.com/pivotal/pivotal_ide_prefs), each of which can be downloaded and installed from their respective repositories.

The Atom keybindings, being similar to the Sublime bindings are built off of the Sublime Bindings with relevant modifications based on the Atom Editor Cheat Sheet from bugsnag.(http://d2wy8f7a9ursnm.cloudfront.net/atom-editor-cheat-sheet.pdf)

I am currently looking into finding some people who are far more familiar with SublimeText and Atom to test these key bindings and offer any suggestions for improvement.

##Next Actions
1. Start working on github/VCS shortcuts across all bindings.
2. Clean up and improve documentation for this repository
